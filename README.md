## Overview
This is the first challenge recommended the Frontend Mentor platform. The goal was to use HTML and CSS to recreate the QR code png attached in the design files. It was a very simple project to 
get the hang of the platform but I still learned a few things creating it.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

Even though this was a simple project I did have difficulties when uploaded it to Github pages. For some reason everything looked good except the image of the QR code would not show. After looking through the console I tried taking out the '/' from the path /images, and the code popped up. I then changed my code and pushed it again to see the finished project.

### Continued development

I'm new to frontend development and hope you use more advanced techniques while styling components in the future.
